## Project Overview
With the rise in demand for online food delivery services, understanding customer behavior and operational performance is critical. This project analyzes a dataset from **FoodHub**, a food aggregator company, to identify actionable insights for optimizing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Objective
Perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on FoodHub’s order data to:
- Understand customer behavior and restaurant preferences
